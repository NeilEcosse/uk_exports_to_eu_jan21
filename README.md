### Notes on this report

The workings behind the plots are saved in the file `analysis/uk_to_eu_exports_jan_2021` (available in .Rmd and HTML formats).

The report uses data on UK exports from this Excel file:

https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/datasets/uktradeallcountriesseasonallyadjusted/current/allcountriesjan2021final.xlsx


I have copied the EU data from the *Monthly Exports* tab into a separate csv saved in the `data_raw` folder, which is the one I'm using for the plots.

The full Excel file is also saved for reference in the `data_raw` folder.
